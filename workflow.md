# Team Workflow

Stick to these short guidelines. Just do it.

## Stand-Ups

Twice a week (check your calendar):

1. Tuesdays
2. Fridays

## Asana Workflow

`🚀 Weekly Stand-Up` board is our central cooperation hub.

1. **Discuss**: Tasks that need to be discussed go into `📆 Upcoming Stand-Up Topics`. The board serves as talking points for our next Stand-Up. Each task gets addressed during Stand-Up, then moved further down the pipeline.
2. **Do**: `⚡️ Complete By Next Stand-Up` should _only_ contain **actionable items** that can be completed until the next Stand-Up. This board fills up as we discuss tasks from step 1, and needs to be empty by the time the next Stand-Up comes around. Tasks in here need to be:
    - **actionable**: They can actually be completed, not just thought about.
    - **assigned**: Someone is responsible for the completion. The task is assigned.
    - **time-bound**: It has a due date. If none provided, that means until the next Stand-Up.
3. **Ponder**: The third section, `🍶 Topics to Marinate` can hold tasks that don't fit the category of step 2, but we still want to keep the topic in our shared consciousness. These tasks should eventually graduate to step 2, or otherwise need to be discussed again, broken up in smaller tasks, or, if they become obsolete, removed.

---

**The Swamp**: Any task that doesn't fit in one of the three categories should be moved to _the swamp_. (Currently) all other Asana boards are a mix of actionable, non-actionable, job-personal tasks, notes, things-to-keep-in-mind etc.

Everyone is responsible to keep their own swamp in check. Work on these tasks whenever you have time and complete whatever you can. If, in your swamp explorations, you stumble upon a task that would benefit from team-wide attention, pop it into the appropriate column in `🚀 Weekly Stand-Up` and we'll move it down the pipeline.

That's all. Let's get cracking!
